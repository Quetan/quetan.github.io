= Hummingbird Features to Speed Up WordPress =

### Scan and One-Click Fix

Hummingbird is a WordPress speed optimization plugin. It will scan your site, find files that are slowing it down, and provide tips and fixes for making your site run at top speed.

Hummingbird even has one-click improvements like a full cache suite, one-click minify for styles and scripts, and deferring CSS and JS for quickly optimizing performance. What could be easier!

### World-Class Caching

You’ll get a world-class caching suite, including full-page, browser, and Gravatar cache.

Make your site load even faster with Hummingbird’s complete set of cache tools that give your visitors a faster browsing experience. Including full-page, browser and Gravatar caching.

### Asset Optimization

Did you know that the more files you add to your site’s header, the slower it will load? With Hummingbird, you can easily customize the load position of your CSS, JavaScript (defer CSS and Javascript), Google Fonts, and other files to increase your page speed.

Quickly reorder, compress, and reposition files with Hummingbird’s minification feature. But play carefully – minification is a powerful tool (though if you need it, you can reset any changes you make in one click).

### Transfer Data at Top Speed With GZIP

Hummingbird has GZIP powers to make sharing your site more efficient.

Sending zipped files is faster and can save you money on hosting. And don’t worry about setup, send Hummingbird instructions with the click of a button and she’ll handle the rest.

### Built-in Cloudflare Integration

Hummingbird can be used to control your [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) browser cache and Automatic Platform Optimizations (APO) settings as well! Simply add your Cloudflare API key and configure away.

### Fully Compatible With Smush Image Optimization

You can complement Hummingbird’s WordPress speed optimization features with our award-winning sister-plugin [Smush image optimization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/). Smush compresses your images, giving your site less to load – and thus a faster load time. Hummingbird + Smush integrate perfectly together, and are the perfect match to speed up WordPress.

Compress, optimize (optimise), and fix PageSpeed performance with properly sized images, lazy load, next-gen WebP convert, image formatting, and more.

### Save time with Hummingbird Configs

Configs allow you to save your prefered Hummingbird configuration settings and apply them to your other sites in a few clicks. You can create unlimited configs.

= Faster Websites Rank Higher, Convert Better =

Every millisecond counts: your visitors expect an ever-faster website, with a page load time of under two seconds expected - and the norm. If visitors *don’t* get that on your site, they *will* leave.

If you’re running a business website or eCommerce store, that means **if your website does not load quickly, you will lose sales.**

Hummingbird is here to help you; it’s a one of a kind WordPress performance optimization plugin that can make your site run at superspeed, for free!

You get our WordPress performance optimization suite, which includes minification and GZIP for small page sizes, full caching for faster loading, and integration with Cloudflare’s APO / browser cache, and our sister-plugin [Smush image optimization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/).

Hummingbird is built with ease-of-use in mind; it makes your WordPress site faster, but it’s also fast to set up. You can scan your site and implement recommended changes in one-click, getting a fast site in mere minutes.

All the above is free and will speed up WordPress for you. **If you need the very fastest WordPress site, [you should get a WPMU DEV Membership](https://wpmudev.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=hummingbird-readme&utm_content=you_should_get_wpmudev_membership#trial).**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need Hummingbird if I already have caching like WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache? =

Yes! Of course, our cache suite is more than enough, but if you already use WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache, the special monitoring tools Hummingbird offers still make it worth it. To ensure compatibility, only activate overlapping features in one of the plugins.

Yes! Hummingbird is built to take full advantage of Cloudflare features. Just plug in your API to get started.

= Does Hummingbird work with WooCommerce? =

Yes! Hummingbird works great with ecommerce plugins like WooCommerce and MarketPress. For best results, when configuring full-page cache, follow the WooCommerce recommended cache settings. Hummingbird will exclude the cart, my account and checkout pages to keep content dynamic.

= Somebody help! I turned on Asset Optimization and it broke my site!? =

Asset Optimization is a great way to speed up your site but moving, combining, using minify, and rearranging CSS and JavaScript (.JS) files can also mess with styling and break functionality. We recommend making incremental changes and testing your site as you go so you can undo the changes if something breaks. And remember, don’t panic. If something goes wrong you can start over with the click of a button :)

== Screenshots ==

1. Scan your site for optimization tips and tricks.
2. Use the complete suite of cache tools to speed up load times.
3. Asset Optimization lets you combine and reposition CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files.
4. Use suggestions to make improvements and speed up your site.
